it began with 7 towers. maybe build by only one architect, maybe more. 
but eh, there are so much more to do! and we found more towers. 
more poorly-placed-and-thought towers. ok, we can say it: more crappytowers.

...

so... this is sort of an "art pack" with crappy colored stuff.
This one was inspired by the Exalted Funeral Discord & Jam.
but I'll may do some other "art packs" from time to time, 
based on other inspirations (fewer towers, more creatures).
You can find me on the World-Wide-toWer by searching "angela quidam".
